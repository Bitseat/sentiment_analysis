# sentiment_analysis
Today, methods for automatic opinion mining on online data are becoming increasingly relevant. Over the
past few years, methods have been developed that can successfully and with a great degree of accuracy
analyze the sentiment in opinions from digital English text. These developments enable research into
prediction of sentiment. In many cases, opinions are hidden in long forum posts and blogs. It is very difficult
for a human reader to find relevant sources, extract pertinent sentences, read them, summarize them and
organize them into usable forms. An automated opinion mining and summarization system is thus needed.
In this repo, we experiment with different approaches to automatically extract opinions from Amharic text.
In addition we collect and make available the tools developed and the corpus collected that we believe will help in
making progress on works related to Amharic language processing.
